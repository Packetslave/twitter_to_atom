Twitter to RSS converter. Reads the twitter feed for one or more users and
writes RSS files to a specified directory.

I use this to read twitter in my feed reader instead of wading through
the timeline.

To use:
- edit config.json with your Twitter API credentials and user/output location
- edit users.txt to list the users you want to view

See http://developers.twitter.com to register for a free developer account and
get your API keys.
