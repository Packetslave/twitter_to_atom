Twitter to Atom converter. Reads a twitter feed using the search API and 
prints a very basic Atom feed to stdout. 

I use this to read twitter in my feed reader instead of wading through
the timeline.

To build:
$ cd twitter_to_atom
$ go build

To run:
$ ./twitter_to_atom packetslave > /var/www/packetslave.atom
